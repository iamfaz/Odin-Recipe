        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dark brown suga</li>r
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flou</li>r
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 tbsp matcha powder</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>black sesame seeds (topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking trays with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, matcha powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a microwave safe bowl, place the butter and white chocolate and microwave on high for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Remove from microwave and stir the mixture a bit.</li>
        <li>Return to the microwave and microwave on high for 30 seconds once again.</li>
        <li>Then remove the bowl and stir until all of the chocolate chips have completely melted.</li>
        <li>Return the chocolate butter mixture back to the microwave and microwave on high for another 15 seconds.</li>
        <li>Remove and stir the chocolate mixture once again 
            (make sure to whisk until the butter is fully incorporated in the melted chocolate and you have a thick chocolate paste; 
            this may take a while. The butter should not be separated from the melted chocolate!)</li>
        <li>Then place the melted chocolate off to the side to allow it to cool a bit as you prepare the rest of the cookie batter.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, put in the egg and both sugars.</li>
        <li>Using an electric mixer, whisk together the egg and sugars on medium high speed for 5 minutes (this time is important!).</li>
        <li>With the mixer still on, slowly pour in the chocolate butter mixture into the large bowl 
            (if the butter has separated from the chocolate, whisk to combine once again before pouring over the eggs).</li>
        <li>Introduce half of the dry ingredients from the small bowl, into the large bowl with the mixer still on and just lightly mix for about 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>Then pour the rest of the dry ingredients in and mix until the dry ingredients are well combined (about 15-20 seconds).</li>
        <li>Immediately start portioning out the cookie dough by placing a heaping tablespoon of cookie batter onto two lined baking trays (5 per tray).</li>
        <li>Top each cookie with a sprinkle of black sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Put both trays in the oven, on the same level, and bake for ~13 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the trays from the oven and allow to cool for another 15 minutes before transferring to a wire rack, then enjoy!</li>
